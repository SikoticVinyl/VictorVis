### The Proposal
Utilizing data found on HLTV.org for the game Counter-Strike, we will sort thrrough the top players and/or
teams of said eSport, and determinee whether or not we can successfully determine the victor of a match (solo v solo or team v team). The data that will be used in particular to determine what models are best fit for this collection of data will be KDR, KPR, as well as player rating and other stats that will be determined as we filter through the data.

The technologise we used for this project are:
- Python-- to scrape data from HLTV.org
- Pandas-- to create, clean, and filter dataframes of the gathered data
- SciKitLearn-- used for creating models, training/testing/splitting data, and checking accuracy scores
- Encoding-- to ensure data included within the datasets are all int/float to not interfere with models
- Supervised Machine Learning-- the data gathered is all physical and true data gathered over time.

### Steps of Progress

1) Collecting the Data
Over the span of two days, the group determined to utilize data found on HLTV.org.
Getting this data was a fairly difficult task as we had to build two separate scrapers.
The first scrape gathered data from a main page that only had minimal raw data. This data
did not provide enough content, so a secondary scraper was made delving deeper into HLTV,
diving into personal data that was included on each player's page. This provided a lot more
data.

2) Cleaning/Filtering the Data

What you want to do:
Utilizing data found in APIs for certain eSports, Valorant and League of Legends in particular, we will organize through the top players and/or teams of the eSport, and then use that to determine whether or not it is possible to successfully predict a victor in a tournament/competition environment. The data that will be used when accessed are the KDR (kill-death-ratio) of the Team and Individual members, as well as the win-rate. Extra data that can be used for more accurate results could be DPS (damage per second), and possibly how long a specific user has played the game (if this data is included).

Technologies Planned to Use:
API requests
Pandas
MatPlotLib
SciKitLearn
Supervised ML Learning
Encoding (OneHot or Other)
TrainTestSplit


This is a smalll change for example.
