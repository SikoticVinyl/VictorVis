Project Group Name:
VictorVis(Victory Vision)

Project Participants:
Shayne Powell, Spencer Buck, Dana Fulmer, Chace Snedecor

What you want to do:
Utilizing data found in APIs for certain eSports, Valorant and League of Legends in particular, we will organize through the top players and/or teams of the eSport, and then use that to determine whether or not it is possible to successfully predict a victor in a tournament/competition environment. The data that will be used when accessed are the KDR (kill-death-ratio) of the Team and Individual members, as well as the win-rate. Extra data that can be used for more accurate results could be DPS (damage per second), and possibly how long a specific user has played the game (if this data is included).

Technologies Planned to Use:
API requests
Pandas
MatPlotLib
SciKitLearn
Supervised ML Learning
Encoding (OneHot or Other)
TrainTestSplit


This is a smalll change for example.
